A basic Next.js React App using a modified version of the starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) and the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/?apix=true) to search for books based on user input. 

A user can type a keyword into the search box and click the "search books" button to search. A table will display the search results including the book's title, subtitle, author, and a thumbnail. The search results are limited to a maximum of 3 books.
